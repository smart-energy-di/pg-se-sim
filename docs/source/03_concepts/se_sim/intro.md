# Why simulation within "Smart Energy"?

The approach of a simulation has the following aspects:
- you can start small 
- small steps, iterative development of documented dependencies 
- complex systems are more difficult to put into theories and can be simulated or emulated much better
- simulation can later be transferred into emulation, emulations can then become part of the real world (like e.g. emulators in microelectronics)
- simulation results can be presented in different ways (to suit the target group) (multiple "views" and levels of abstraction on data)
- simulations are much more likely to invite participation
- good simulations have real interfaces that can be evaluated
- the whole playground can include multiple simulation approaches so that different levels of abstraction can be explored. Played together, it then becomes a big picture. 
- the big master plan initially only needs to be vision, the focus can be on dedicated parts
- a high level of professionalism in the "simulation framework" also motivates developers at the "big players" in the medium term. 
- the open source approach of a simulation on github also frees from dependencies on individuals (bus factor).
- good simulations can be automated. Changes to the code automatically lead to new documentation (CI/CD pipelines)
- simulations can be versioned
